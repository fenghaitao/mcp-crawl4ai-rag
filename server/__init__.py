Server components for Simics RAG system.

This package contains server-side functionality including:
- User manual chunking system
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) server implementations
- Client integrations (OpenAI, Dashscope, iFlow, etc.)
- Code summarization utilities

Originally located in src/, this has been reorganized to server/
to better reflect its role in the overall architecture.
