"""
Core functionality for Simics RAG and Knowledge Graph operations.

This package contains the main CLI interface and core utilities for:
- RAG pipeline operations (crawling, chunking, querying)
- Knowledge graph management (planned)
- Database operations and migrations
- Development and debugging tools

The package structure follows the reorganization from the original scripts/
directory to provide a more organized and maintainable codebase.
